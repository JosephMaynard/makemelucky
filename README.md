# Make Me Lucky

Make Me Lucky is a hobby site I built in part to try out some new animation techniques, but also to fulfil the needs of hapless people searching for luck on the Internet, without trying to exploit them!

The site uses:
* [Velocity.js](http://velocityjs.org/)
* [Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

The site has an achievement system where you receive "Lucky Charms" for reaching certain goals (e.g. visiting the site on a certain number of consecutive days). They are stored in the browser with HTML5 Local Storage.

You can visit the site (and get lucky!) [here](https://makemelucky.com/)
